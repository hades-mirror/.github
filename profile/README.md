# .github

This is where I (https://github.com/oracularhades) put mirrors for libraries where it would be devestating for a supply-chain attack to occur (such as https://github.com/oracularhades/hades-auth , https://github.com/oracularhades/region-system , https://github.com/oracularhades/rover ). If I'm slow approving a new release into the mirror, please create a Github issue for that repo. I'll try to stay on-top of it best I can.
